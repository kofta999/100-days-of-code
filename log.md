# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 23, 2023

**Today's progress**: Starting learning how to test code using chai, mocha and sinon.

**Thoughts:** Testing seems pretty boring at first, but I believe It'd be more fun when I get used to it more.

### Day 2: October 24, 2023

**Today's progress**: Dived deeper into testing and learned using mock databases and testing code that needs auth.

**Thoughts:** Chai and mocha seems kinda old? I feel I need to search more about more common testing frameworks to try them out.

### Day 3: October 25, 2023

**Today's progress**: Decided to learn more about SQL syntax and did some coding exercises on it.

**Thoughts:** I felt that I needed to get more understanding on SQL so I can understand ORMs better.

### Day 4: October 26, 2023

**Today's progress**: Finished more exercices on SQL and started working on an open source project.

**Thoughts:** Well, time to work on another express project, hope I gain some new experience and knowledge from it.
